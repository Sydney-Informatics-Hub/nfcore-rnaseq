This episode is gives an overview of nextflow and nfcore. 

## Nextflow 
- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) is a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. 
- Nextflow enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers. 
- It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
- It allows the adaptation of pipelines written in the most common scripting languages.

## nfcore
[nfcore](https://nf-co.re/) is a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.
