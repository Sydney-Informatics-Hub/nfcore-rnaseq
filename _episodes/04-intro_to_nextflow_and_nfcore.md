This episode is gives an overview of nextflow and nfcore. 

## Nextflow 
- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) is a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. 
- Nextflow enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers. 
- It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
- It allows the adaptation of pipelines written in the most common scripting languages.

## nfcore
- [nfcore](https://nf-co.re/) is a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.
- It is a diverse project spread across many groups.
- Currently [65 pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines) are available as a part of nfcore.
- Some of the most commonly used nfcore pipelines include [nfcore-rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq), [nfcore-sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek) and [nfcore-ampliseq](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq) amongst otheres.
- A set of nfcore [companion tools](https://nf-co.re/tools/) are made available to assist with common tasks associated with nfcore pipeline usage.
