This episode introduces the main aims of this workshop, which are 1) Nextflow 2) A nextflow-nfcore pipeline 'rnaseq' 3) Deploying the nfcore-rnaseq on Nimbus VM instance.


# Australian BioCommons
The Australian BioCommons is an ambitious new [digital infrastructure capability](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) that is enhancing Australian research in its ability to understand the molecular basis of life across environmental, agricultural and biomedical science.

# The Sydney Informatics Hub
The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a _[Core Research Facility](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities.html)_ of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individual Faculties to purchase and maintain. The classic example might be the room-size electron-microscopes, built into specialised rooms in the Sydney Microscopy & Microanalysis unit.
