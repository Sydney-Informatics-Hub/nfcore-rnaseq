This episode introduces the main aims of this workshop 1) Nextflow 2) A nextflow-nfcore pipeline 'rnaseq' 3) Deploying the nfcore-rnaseq on Nimbus VM instance.

# Aims of this workshop
- An introduction to RNA Sequencing and RNASeq analysis.
- Why use nextflow workflows for RNASeq analysis.
- How to deploy the pipeline nfcore-rnaseq on Pawsey-Nimbu VM intance.
- Downstream analysis using R programming.


# BioCommons Australia


# The Sydney Informatics Hub
The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a _[Core Research Facility](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities.html)_ of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individual Faculties to purchase and maintain. The classic example might be the room-size electron-microscopes, built into specialised rooms in the Sydney Microscopy & Microanalysis unit.
