## What is a [FASTQ format](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual7/fastq_files.html)?
FASTQ files are text files containing sequence data with a quality (Phred) score for each base.

## The four lines which represent a read in FASTQ
- The above example shows a FASTQ read with 50nt in Illumina format (ASCII_BASE=33).
- There are always four lines per read. 
- The first line starts with '@', followed by the label.
- The second line contains the actual sequence.
- The third line starts with '+'. In some variants, the '+' line contains a second copy of the label.
- The fourth line contains the Q scores represented as ASCII characters.
- The quality score is an integer (Q) which is typically in the range 2 - 40
