## The study
Knockout mouse model to study Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS)

WBS, is a rare disease found in people with :
- Distinctive facial features
- Intellectual disability
- Cardiovascular abnormalities


## Experimental design
To improve our understanding of this disease (WBS) , Corley et al. 2016 created a knockout mouse model of this disease.

## Experimental question
- Which genes are upregulated or downregulated in our knockout mice?
- How do these genes relate to the disease phenotype?
 

## Sequencing data 
- As discussed, the raw sequence files are provided in the [FASTQ](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual7/fastq_files.html) format.

- **Analysis Part-1**: The available virtual machine instances are of a fixed size (16 CPU and 64GB RAM)
- The data used in today's workshop is a small sub-set of the full data.
- The sequences represents a very specific region of ** chromsome 18 ** of the mouse genome.
- We will use this subsetted files for quick processing to generate a count-matrix.


- **Analysis Part-2**: A pre-processed count matrix which represents the complete dataset (downloaded from the [original paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27295951/)) will be used for downstream functional analysis.
