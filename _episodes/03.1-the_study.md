## The study
Knockout mouse model to study Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS)

WBS, is a rare disease found in people with :
- Distinctive facial features
- Intellectual disability
- Cardiovascular abnormalities


## Experimental design
To improve our understanding of this disease (WBS) , Corley et al. 2016 created a knockout mouse model of this disease.

 ## Experimental question
- Which genes (if any) are upregulated or downregulated in our knockout mice?
- How do these genes relate to the disease phenotype?
 

## Sequencing data (subsetted)
- Raw sequence files are provided in FASTQ format.
- **Note:** The virtual machine instances available for training are of limited size (16 CPU and 64GB RAM)
- Hence, the data used in today's workshop is a small subset of the full sequencing (fastq) files.
- The sequences represents a very specific region of ** chromsome 18 ** of the mouse genome.
- We will use this subsetted files for quick processing.
- **Further** A pre-processed count matrix which represents the complete dataset (downloaded from the [original paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27295951/)) will be used for downstream functional analysis.
