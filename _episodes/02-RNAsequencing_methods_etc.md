- It is essentially a process of information transfer between information-carrying polymers; DNA, RNA and proteins.
- The first step in a process of information transfer involves production of an RNA copy of a part of the DNA sequence, called transcription. 
- mRNA is translated into proteins.
- Non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) is processed and assume their functional structures after transcription and without going into translation.
- Thus RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) uses the capabilities of high-throughput sequencing methods to provide insight into the transcriptome of a cell.
