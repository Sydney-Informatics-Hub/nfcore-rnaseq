- The Central dogma of molecular biology highlights the process of information transfer between information-carrying polymers; DNA, RNA and proteins.
- The first step is called transcription which involves production of an RNA copy called messenger RNA (mRNA) from DNA. 
- Next, mRNA is translated into proteins by a process called  translation in 'ribosomes' of the cell.
- [Gene expression](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-gene-expression) is thus the process by which the instructions in our DNA are converted into a functional product, such as a protein or other molecules.
- Non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) is processed and assume their functional structures after transcription and without going into translation.
- RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) uses the capabilities of high-throughput sequencing methods to provide insight into the transcriptome of a cell. 
- Thus using RNA-Seq we can :
- Identify which gene is expressed & how much of it is being expressed under a specific condition.
- Identify variants (SNPs)and allele specific expression.
- Identify novel genes.
- Assemble the transcriptome of an organism.
- Identify alternative splice forms.

Your experimental condition may be a new drug, healthy vs affected patients for a particular disease etc.
