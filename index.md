- No prior experience with RNA-seq analysis is required.

**Pre-requisite(s)**

**(1)** The course **[Nextflow and Supercomputing at Pawsey]()** is an introduction to nextflow pipelines and Pawsey supercomputing. 
- The first half is an introduction to [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) - a tool to develop scientifc workflows.
- The second half is an overview to [Supercomputing at Pawsey](https://pawsey.org.au/supercomputing/). Here we discuss the various computing resources available to a researcher at the Pawsey supercomputing center, one of whch is the Nimbus traiing VM instance (used in this workshop)

(2) Introduction to **[Unix/Linux command line](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/)** 

(3) Introduction to **[R/RStudio](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/)**
