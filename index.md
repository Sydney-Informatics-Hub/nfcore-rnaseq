**An introduction to RNA-seq analysis using the Nextflow bioinformatics pipeline nfcore-rnaseq and RStudio**

**About this workshop**
- RNA-seq is a popular method for simultaneously measuring and comparing the expression of tens of thousands of genes in multiple samples.
- Nextflow is a workflow management tool which assists in pipelining the multiple steps and also enables scalability and reproducibility of these workflows across different compute infrastructures.
- This practical workshop provides a hands-on introduction to RNA-seq analysis from reads to counts, to differential expression to functional enrichments.
- The workshop makes use of nfcore-rnaseq, a nextflow pipeline that allows the researchers to use computational data analysis tools and workflows without the need for programming experience.
- The workshop also introduces the attendies the use of R environment using RStudio for basic downstream analysis of RNA-seq data.

**Target audience**
HDRs, researchers who have or will soon acquire RNA-seq short-read data which they need to analyse themselves or others who desire to understand RNA-seq analysis using pipelining efforts such as Nextflow
