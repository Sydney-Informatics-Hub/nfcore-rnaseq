### Synopsis
An Introduction to Nextflow bioinformatics pipeline **nfcore-rnaseq** for performing **RNA-Seq analysis**

### Target audience
- HDRs, researchers who have, or will soon acquire, RNA-seq short read data that they need to analyse themselves. 
- No prior experience with RNA-seq analysis is required.

### Pre-requisite(s)

**(1)** The course **[Nextflow and Supercomputing at Pawsey]()** is an introduction to nextflow pipelines and Pawsey supercomputing. 
- The first half of this pre-requisite is an Introduction to [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) - a tool to develop scientifc workflows.
- The second half is a overview to [Supercomputing at Pawsey](https://pawsey.org.au/supercomputing/).
- We will do a quick overview of the above two topics today, with context to our workshop.

**(2) Datacarpentry:**   Introduction to **[Unix/Linux command line](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/)** 
- It will be very useful for the trainee to have looked into the materials for the above two essestial elements. 
- We will do a quick revision of basic commands in Unix.

**(3) Datacarpentry:** Introduction to **[R/RStudio](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/)**
- The trainees will be introduced to basic data importing and a few other steps in R.
- They can use the pre-written code-blocks for generating results at various steps.
