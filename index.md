**Synopsis:** Introduction to excecuting the nextflow-nfcore pipeline for RNASeq analysis on a Pawsey Nimbus VM instance

**Target audience:**  HDRs, researchers who have, or will soon acquire, RNA-seq short read data that they need to analyse themselves. No prior experience with RNA-seq analysis is required.


**Pre-requisite(s):** 

(1) The course **[Nextflow and Supercomputing at Pawsey]({{ site.series_home }})** is an introduction to nextflow pipelines and Pawsey supercomputing. 

This first part of the pre-requisite is an Introduction to [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) - a tool to develop scientifc workflows  and the second half is a overview to [Supercomputing at Pawsey](https://pawsey.org.au/supercomputing/).

Although important it not essential to have attended the above course. We will be doing a quick overview of the above two topics in context to this workshop.

(2) Introduction to [Unix/Linux command line](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/) and Introduction to [R/RStudio](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/)
- It will be very useful for the attendee to have looked into the materials for the above two essestial elements. 
- We will try and do a quick revision of basic commands in Unix.
- However it is out of scope of this workshop to learn programming in R. 
- The attendee will be introduced to basic data importing steps in R and can use the pre-written code-blocks for generating results at various steps.
